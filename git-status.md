# Definition: git status

The git status command shows status of current repo, untracked files, staged / unstaged, and shows the message nothing to commit + on branch main.

In Jupyter lab, the same information can be accessed through the Git UI. It shows the current branch, untracked files, and changes to tracked files, just like git status command from bash.
